# straight.el

> The straightforward package manager for Emacs.

This package is a work-in-progress attempt to completely replace
`package.el` and `quelpa` with a more flexible and powerful package
management system.

## FIXME

* Add option for shallow clones
* Don't allow incompatible recipes with the same `:local-repo`
